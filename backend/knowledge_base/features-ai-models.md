# AI Model Builder

Create powerful machine learning models without coding using DataForge AI's automated model development platform.

## Model Types

- **Classification**: Predict categories (e.g., customer churn, product recommendations)
- **Regression**: Forecast numerical values (e.g., sales, pricing optimization)
- **Time Series**: Predict future values based on historical patterns
- **Clustering**: Segment data into natural groupings
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns and outliers
- **Text Analysis**: Extract insights from unstructured text data
- **Image Recognition**: Classify and analyze image content (Enterprise plan only)

## AutoML Features

- **Automated Feature Selection**: Identify the most relevant variables for your model
- **Algorithm Selection**: Automatically test multiple algorithms to find the best performer
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters for maximum accuracy
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensure models generalize well to new data
- **Model Explainability**: Understand which factors drive your model's predictions
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate models with comprehensive accuracy measures

## Deployment Options

- **API Endpoints**: Expose models via REST APIs for integration with other systems
- **Batch Predictions**: Process large datasets in scheduled batches
- **Real-time Scoring**: Get immediate predictions for individual records
- **Model Monitoring**: Track performance and receive alerts when models drift
- **A/B Testing**: Compare multiple models in production environments
- **Version Control**: Maintain multiple versions of each model
