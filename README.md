# CloudFlow Analytics Support Chatbot

An AI-powered customer support chatbot for the fictional CloudFlow Analytics SaaS platform. The chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT model to provide context-aware responses based on a comprehensive knowledge base.

## Features

- **Conversational AI Interface**: Natural language understanding for product inquiries
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Accurate responses based on product documentation
- **Context Awareness**: Remembers conversation history for contextual responses
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Graceful handling of queries outside its knowledge
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Tracks query types and user satisfaction
- **Mobile Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **AI**: Openrouter
- **Database**: SQLite for analytics tracking
- **Deployment**: Docker for easy setup

## System Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture:

1. **Frontend Interface**:
   - Single-page application with responsive design
   - Real-time chat interface with typing indicators
   - User feedback collection (thumbs up/down)

2. **Backend API**:
   - RESTful API endpoints for chat functionality
   - Session management for conversation context
   - OpenAI integration for natural language understanding
   - Analytics collection and reporting

3. **Knowledge Base**:
   - Markdown-based documentation for product information
   - Organized by topics for easy maintenance
   - Converted to context for the LLM

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- OpenAI API key

### Environment Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SECRET_KEY=your_random_secret_key

text

### Running the Application
1. Start the application with docker-compose:
docker-compose up

text
2. Access the web interface at http://localhost

That's it! The application will be running with both frontend and backend services.

## Prompt Engineering Approach

The chatbot uses a carefully structured prompt to generate helpful and accurate responses:

1. **System Context**: Provides the knowledge base information to the LLM
2. **Conversation History**: Includes previous messages for context awareness
3. **Fallback Detection**: Identifies when the query is outside the knowledge domain
4. **Response Formatting**: Ensures consistent and readable responses

The system prompt instructs the LLM to:
- Always remain in the context of CloudFlow Analytics
- Provide specific, actionable information
- Be conversational but professional
- Include specific details from the knowledge base when available
- Clearly indicate when information is not available
